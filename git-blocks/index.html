                <h2>What is Git?</h2>
                <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and cmoe back toa previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into the your app.</p>

                <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
                <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>
